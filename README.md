## Technologies Used

This project is built with a robust stack of technologies designed for modern web development. Below is an overview of the key technologies and libraries utilized:

### Core Technologies

- **React (v18.2.0)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling the development of dynamic and responsive web apps.
- **Redux (v5.0.1)** and **@reduxjs/toolkit (v2.1.0)**: Used for state management across the React app, simplifying the management of complex state interactions.
- **React Router DOM (v6.21.3)**: Manages the routing of our single-page application, enabling navigation without full page reloads.

### Development Tools

- **Vite (v5.0.8)**: A modern front-end build tool that significantly improves the development experience with fast hot module replacement (HMR).
- **ESLint (v8.55.0)**: Lints JavaScript code, enforcing best practices and coding standards to ensure code quality.
- **PostCSS (v8.4.33)** and **Autoprefixer (v10.4.17)**: Process CSS with JavaScript, automatically adding vendor prefixes to CSS rules.
