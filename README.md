### Backstory
My journey into the world of events commenced around 2017 during my university days. Immersing myself in the vibrant atmosphere of tech events became a passion, providing me with invaluable connections among like-minded individuals. The pinnacle of this journey was my final year project, CohMat, a social networking platform tailored for university students. CohMat, short for Cohort Matchup, aimed to break down broad study fields into specialized subfields, creating groups within the system for users to join based on their areas of expertise.

Fast forward to 2021, a pivotal year where my involvement in events took an unexpected turn. A close friend, who happened to be a music producer, approached me with a unique challenge. He needed an event management system to streamline the organization of events for his artist clients. While we successfully implemented an ERP system, it turned out to be an overkill for their needs. Moreover, the absence of an ideal user portal meant individual artists couldn’t manage their events directly. Instead, they had to relay details to the music producer, who would then handle the event creation and management. This limitation fueled my determination to develop a superior solution — one that empowers each user with full control over their events through a comprehensive dashboard. The vision was to create a platform that puts the power in the hands of the artists, allowing them to manage and showcase their events independently.
